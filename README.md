The useThrottle Hook Polyfill project provides a custom React hook to limit the rate at which a function can be invoked. This is useful for optimizing performance in applications with frequent user input, like search boxes. By using this hook, developers can ensure smoother user experiences by reducing the number of function calls during rapid user interactions.
